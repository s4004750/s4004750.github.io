    that a lot of media players that are meant for students who are studying (specifically) can look
    aethetically really quite boring. So using a 2000s cd-player as the core image, not only 
    makes the webpage more attractive to the viewer, it also doesnt deter their attention from whatever
    work they are aiming to complete. -->
