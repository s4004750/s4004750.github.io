    <h2>
        Question1
    </h2>
    <p1>
        Question One:The first initial part of the website, https://brooomstick.com/ 
        that caught my attention was the sweeping action of the janitor image. 
        This caught my eye right away as it moves when you start to scroll along the website
         it creates an almost interactive animation as it is controlled by the user.
    </p1>
    <h2>
        Question 2
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sweeping of rubbish.</li>
        <li>Texter animation.</li>
        <li>Motion graphics</li>
        <li>Text graphics</li>
        <li>Scroll animation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p2>
        All of these discrete actions work together to create a very stimulating and attractive interactive experience. More importantly, it engages the user and makes the issue they are focusing on more interesting and easier to absorb, than a normal webpage. 
    </p2>
    <h3>
        Question 3
    </h3>
    <p3>
        I spent the most part of the experience engaging with the scroll 
        feature and looking at what different kinds of transitions or 
        characteristics emerge from each section of the website. 
        I found that this made me want to spend more time on the website analysing what
         surfaces and what disappears.ecejc s

    <h4>
        Question 4
    </h4>
    <p4>
        The most common action within the two-minute interaction I had with the website was 
        the use of scroll and image to create motion, which in return created a storyline within
         the webpage.
