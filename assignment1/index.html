    <h1>Interactive Media Assignment One</h1>

    <p>Researching the interactive experience of a website, <a href="https://brooomstick.com/"> broomstick.com</a>
        </p>
    <p>
        <img src="../website1.png" width="200"/> 
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Question1
    </h3>
    <p1>
         The first initial part of the website I chose,
         that caught my attention was the sweeping action of the janitor image. 
         This caught my eye right away as it moves when you start to scroll along the website
         it creates an extremely interactive animation as it is controlled by the user.
    </p1>
    <h3>
        Question 2
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sweeping of rubbish.</li>
        <li>Texter animation.</li>
        <li>Motion graphics</li>
        <li>Text graphics</li>
        <li>Scroll animation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p1>
         All of these discrete actions work together to create a very stimulating and
         attractive interactive experience. The main issue they are focusing on within 
         the webpage is the importance and value of professions and changing these 
         prejudiced views on jobs such as Janitors. More importantly, it engages the 
         user and makes the issue they are focusing on more interesting and easier to
          absorb, than a normal webpage. 
    </p1>
    <h3>
        Question 3
    </h3>
    <p3>
        I spent the most part of the experience engaging with all the various kinds 
        of scroll features, as well as looking at the different kinds of transitions
         or characteristics emerge from each section of the website as your progress. 
         I found that this made me excited to spend more time on the website, to be 
         able to analyse what surfaces and what disappears throughout the website. 
    </p3>
    <h3>
        Question 4
    </h3>
    <p4>
        During the brief two-minute interaction I had with the website, the leading
         motion revolved around engaging with the scrolling feature and lively imagery,
          which successfully produced a sense of motion which intricately animated
           together to help form the narrative within the webpage.
    </p4>
    <h3>
        Question 5
    </h3>
    <p5>
        My impression of the experience was that, by using fun and engaging 
        programming of images to create animation, helped incredibly to inform
         the user about these professions. The intended primary goal is to expose
          the prominence and significance of these kind of professions and how 
          many do go, without recognition and find themselves becoming victims of
           prejudice in the workplace.
    </p5>
    <h3>
        Question 6
    </h3>
    <p6>The websites interactive attributes help to communicate their goal 
        of showing people how underappreciated people in these professions 
        truly are. They successfully communicate this idea by using short, 
        concise and meaningful text along with large, eye-catching images 
        that work in harmony with fleeting motion graphics. This allows for 
        the website to be more interactive with the viewer. This artistic 
        process helps catch the users attention and entices them to want to
         further explore the website.  
    </p6>
    <h3>
        Question 7
    </h3>
    <p7>
        In this case, the websites intention holds a lot of modern-day 
        relation as well as a connection to the past. I found that I 
        spent a lot of time on this website, going back and forth playing, 
        interacting and figuring out what interactive experience provides a 
        physical response within the website design. This website isn’t intended
         for long term engagement. I believe its intention is to grab the users 
         attention and withhold it until they have either completed the experience
          or absorbed all the information. Either way, this webpage is designed 
          primarily for the short-term engagement of a user. This is easily seen 
          through the lack of intense material and additional resources. 
    </p7>
    <h3>
        Question 8
    </h3>
    <p8>
        The website is able to communicate its ideal intention to be interacted
         with having, essentially a straightforward process throughout the experience.
          The webpage doesn’t stray far from the qualities that are shown as soon as 
          you begin interacting with it. However, the interactive components that it
           obtains aren’t those of that are going to bring the user back, time and time
            again. This website is primarily an information source with fascinating and 
            appealing interactive components.
    </p8>
    <h3>
        Question 9
    </h3>
    <p9>
        This website references many other media forms throughout the website, such as:
    </p9>
    <ol>
        <li>Tourism</li>
        <li>Cost of living</li>
        <li>Ecosystem</li>
        <li>Tear-off flyers</li>
        <li>Artworks</li>
        <li>Instagram</li>
        <li>Telegram</li>
    </ol>
    <p9>Throughout the webpage experience it is noted that the creator is heavily 
        influenced by mixed media, as they use newspaper styled images throughout 
        the commencement of the entire website. The creator also likes to take 
        inspiration from other media forms such as tourism, cost of living and the
         ecosystem, these are mainly used to grab the users attention in order to 
         enlighten the issue in simple terms. Other media forms such as artworks, 
         Instagram and Telegram are used to convey the message or to otherwise allow 
         the user to further explore other work the creator has done. </p9>
    <h3>
        Question 10
    </h3>
    <p10>The application of paper/stop motion graphics within this particular 
        interactive experience branches from a thoughtful consideration of user 
        behaviour and psychology. Particularly, this decision explores the intrinsic
         association between paper and the duty of individuals tasked with tidying 
         up after others. By utilising this visual motif, the interactive webpage 
         definitely does tap into hidden cognitive relations. Using textures such as
          crumpled up paper shows this connection vividly. The creator frequently 
          shows how over time people in these professions have been appreciated, 
          such as showing and documenting artworks Janitors have specifically been in.
           This is done to reimagine the persona and stop the preconception we have 
           against these people. </p10>
    <h3>
        Question 11
    </h3>
    <p11>
        The emotional response this media evokes in the user is sympathy and the
         realisation of misjudgement towards these people. It evokes the feeling 
         of wanting to do better and feel more appreciative of these people who 
         are really one of the most important civil servants. This is due to the 
         graphics and visual styles as well as factual statements to uphold the 
         values within the webpage. 
    </p11>
    <h3>
        Question 12
    </h3>
    <p12>
        The most frustrating part of the webpage for me personally, was the aspect 
        that there are no links to any of the works or facts that they state. 
        This may only be frustrating to those who want to further explore the 
        actual issue the webpage looks at, however it makes it difficult to justify
         the factual statements or artworks they use.
    </p12>
    <h3>
        Question 13
    </h3>
    <p13>
        The most satisfying part of this whole interaction is the way the page
         scrolls. I love how it is constantly changing, where it goes from a regular
          scroll to the images changing whilst using the scroll motion. Or when the 
          scroll is used to make a graphic “walk past”, these little details make 
          the interaction all the more intriguing to the user. Another detail of the
           web design that is satisfying, was their colour palette, they never strayed
            far from the grey, green, black, blue and white colour scheme, other than 
            when they used red hearts to symbolise appreciation for these workers. 
            This design aspect helps to create a more uniform design.
